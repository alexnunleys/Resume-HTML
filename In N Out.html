<h1>In-N-Out, 2020</h1>
    <img height="800" src="./In N Out.jpeg" alt="Illustrative Typography Image">
        <p>A fun little project in my Typography course. We were tasked to take a short saying or idea and use typography in a creative and exciting way. Being from California, I chose In-N-Out: a local burger chain that is all about quality burgers and the "Cali Vibe". I brought elements of California into the poster, having the ocean in the background as well as giving the letters a wind and weather-swept look, similar to the lifeguard towers are sprinkled across the beach. This piece was accepted into the University of Northern Colorado's Annual Student Exhibition for 2020</p>
